I did this talk as a result of participating in a large scale production readiness initiative at InVisionApp.

The short of it:

* Participation from most (all?) engineering teams
* Massive cross-team AND successful effort
* Evaluating 40+ new services
* Lots of folks at InVision were responsible for organizing it and keeping it on the rails:
    * [Karl M](https://github.com/relistan)
    * Brady K
    * Cass H
    * .. and many, many others

_Thanks to Logan D for organizing PDX Go and Cloudability for offering their space._
