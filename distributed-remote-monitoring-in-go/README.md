## CFP - Abstract

A brief showcase on how one can tackle complex remote monitoring problems in a modern way using `9volt` - a distributed monitoring system written in Go and backed by etcd.

## CFP - Description

Remote monitoring is an age old problem and there a bunch of ways to solve it. Nagios is a thing that often comes to mind, but it's 2017... These days, we want our monitoring to be easily configurable, deployable, ultra-reliable and easy to scale and query.

The talk describes how `9volt` can simplify your remote monitoring story and presents a potential monitoring problem and how one could go about solving it.

Note: `9volt` is looking for contributors! If you are interested in this problem domain, please feel free to peruse the [open issues](https://github.com/9corp/9volt/issues) and join the discussion!
